# 🏡 Advanced Regression - House Price Prediction

## 🚀 Competition Summary
This project is part of the **Advanced Regression House Prices** Kaggle competition, where the goal is to predict house prices based on various features using advanced regression techniques.

## 🏆 My Approach
After watching multiple regression tutorials and experimenting with various techniques, I refined my approach to achieve a **Top 500 Rank on Kaggle**. Below are the key steps taken to improve the model's performance:

### 📌 Model Selection
I experimented with several powerful regressors:
- **CatBoost Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

### 🔄 Pipeline Implementation
To streamline the workflow, I used **sklearn’s Pipeline** to:
- Standardize the data preprocessing steps.
- Ensure consistency in training and testing.
- Reduce the chances of data leakage.

### 🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used **GridSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
- Although **Random Search** could have been used, the need was to achieve the **best hyperparameter values**, making **Grid Search** the preferred choice.
